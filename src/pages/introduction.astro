			JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at
			Netscape Communications. It was originally called LiveScript, but was
			renamed to JavaScript in 1996 to avoid confusion with Java. JavaScript is
			a client-side scripting language, which means that it is executed by the
			browser on the user's computer.
